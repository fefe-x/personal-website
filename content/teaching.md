# Teaching

Study material for courses I've taught as a TA. Detailed weekly notes on the content of my weekly exercise sessions can be found at the respective pages. I hope these may prove useful to some!

## [Linear Algebra HS23](./linear_algebra)


## [Analysis I FS24](./analysis_i)


# Resources for other courses

I've created Anki decks for the courses Algorithms and Probability and Parallel Programming. You can find them [here](anw-pprog-anki.apkg).
