# Linear Algebra HS23

### [Week 1: Vectors and linear combinations](week1.pdf)

- Recommended: Chapters 0-2 of 3b1b Essence of Linear Algebra (see [Resources](resources))

### [Week 2: Linear independence, dot product](week2.pdf)

- Recommended: Chapter 3 of 3b1b Essence of Linear Algebra (see [Resources](resources))

### [Week 3: Matrix multiplication, CR decomposition, Gaussian Elimination](week3.pdf)

- This [book](https://www.math.brown.edu/streil/papers/LADW/LADW_2021_01-11.pdf#page=49) has a good and more in depth explanation of Gaussian Elimination

### [Week 4: solution set of SLE, inverse of a matrix and how to find it, LU decomposition](week4.pdf)

- My approach for solving the Moodle quiz "(In)dependent columns in 3 by 3 matrix" can be found [here](quiz_approach)

### [Week 5: LU decomposition continued, vector spaces, subspaces, basis, dimension, column/null space](week5.pdf)

### [Week 6: Column and null space of a matrix, how to compute a basis for them, revision of concepts from previous weeks](week6.pdf)

### [Week 7: RREF, general solution of SLE, geometric interpretation of matrix vector multiplication, fundamental subspaces](week7.pdf)

- Animations: [1](1.mp4)  [2](2.mp4)  [3](3.mp4)  [4](4.mp4), [code](scene.py)

- [Visualization of the fundamental four subspaces](https://www.desmos.com/3d/d8fb99479d)

### [Week 8: Solutions to recap exercise and quiz, tips on writing proofs](week8.pdf)

- This week we did a recap on the material covered in the first half of the course. The used material (exercises and quiz) can be found [here](recap).

### [Week 9: Fundamental subspaces, least squares, orthonormality](week9.pdf)

### [Week 10: Projections, orthonormality, Gram-Schmidt, Pseudoinverses](week10.pdf)

### [Week 11: Pseudoinverses, Determinant](week11.pdf)

### [Week 12: Determinant, Complex Numbers, Eigenvalues and eigenvectors](week12.pdf)

- You can find the quiz [here](quiz12.pdf).

- I collected a few short proof exercises [here](proofs12.pdf) which I can recommend! Especially the statement of exercise 1 is quite interesting and important.

- [This pdf](https://igl.ethz.ch/teaching/linear-algebra/la2020/notes/komplexe_zahlen.pdf) contains on complex numbers and might be helpful for solving exercises 3,4,7 (they're quite extensive, the most important facts can be found in [my](week12.pdf)).

- [This book](https://www.math.brown.edu/streil/papers/LADW/LADW_2021_01-11.pdf#page=88) has proofs on properties of the determinant if you're interested.

### [Week 13: Change of basis, Eigenvalue decomposition, Spectral Theorem](week13.pdf)

- You can find this week's quiz [here](quiz13.pdf) and solutions in the.

### [Week 14: Singular Value Decomposition](week14.pdf)

- You can find this week's quiz [here](quiz14.pdf) and solutions in the.

- [Cool application of SVD: Image Compression](https://timbaumann.info/svd-image-compression-demo/)

I personally recommend to do as many of the exercises as possible - I believe one can learn the most this way!

If you want to use linear algebra in code or test/compute stuff:

- [https://www.wolframalpha.com/](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) (easy text input)

Some textbooks that I personally like and can recommend! I personally think it's a good idea to use multiple textbooks: It might be that one author's way of explaining concepts works much better for you than that of others.
