# Felix Breuer

CS @ ETH Zurich

Currently working on bandit convex optimization under supervision of Prof. Kevin Jamieson and Alireza Bakhtiari.

I'm broadly interested in ML, theory, applied math and statistics.

Some areas I'm particularly interested in at the moment: bandits and online learning, optimization, AI alignment, RL reasoning, diffusion and flow models, history and philosophy of science
